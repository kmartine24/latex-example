\maketitle
\section{Jason Nielsen's research project}

My computational research is on using Jupyter Lab for analysis calculations and developing end-to-end pipelines for Monte Carlo generation.
I am learning about RDataFrames, mapping the idioms onto existing idioms for event loops.

\section{Kyla Martinez's research project}
My research is related to Fermilab's Elastic Analysis Facility (EAF). 
My project in part will be to adapt the user interface to help make it more user-friendly.
